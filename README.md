# tpitemtracker 1.9
A map tracker for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Randomizer

Version 1.9: Added Checks and Restored Functionality 

What's new in this version?

Updated Logic!
- I fixed some logic issues, so now the map tracker should be more accurate.

Added Checks!
- I added some checks that were previously missing from Lunar Soap's v1.8 tracker.

Restored Functionality!
- Restored the ability to use the Poe and Bug tracker, as well as moving the buttons for them to be more convenient.


Kudos:

This tracker could not be what it is without the help and guidence of amazing people, please support them and their projects as well!
